<h1>Welcome! Let me tell you about myself</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Susan. I’m a college graduate and graphic designer living in sunny Sunnyvale.</p>

<p>I am also a grease mom to three beautiful and temperamental machines, you can read more about my 1965 Vespa, a 1971 Triumph Bonneville, and a 1961 Datsun Pick-up truck on my blog here. I’ve grown up in California my whole life and am lucky to pursue my passion in my hometown.</p>

<p><span class="italic">Sketches by Susan</span>, my design firm, is a studio where we bring your vision to life. Whether it be restyling a personal blog, revamping your business brand or a creative arts project we’ve done it all. My studio is rooted in timeless designs with a personal touch that makes them unique to you.</p>
