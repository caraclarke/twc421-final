    <p>Susan and I have been together for the last six years. I've spent more hours than I care to remember polishing, shining and fixing anything that isn't doing what it should be doing.</p>

    <p>Big John and I have been acquianted for a little over a year. He came to me in pretty rough shape so we've been taking it slow and steady on the repairs making sure we don't do any more damange to this classic machine.</p>

    <p>I've had Timothy the longest, since I got my license. He's a steady guy who likes to try to hide when somethings wrong but I always figure it out in the end.</p>
